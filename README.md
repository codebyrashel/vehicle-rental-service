# 🚗 Vehicle Rental System  Backend API

A backend API for a vehicle rental management system that manages vehicle inventory with availability tracking, supports customer accounts and profiles, handles vehicle rentals, returns, and cost calculation, and provides secure role-based authentication for admin and customer users.

## ✨Technologies

- `Node.js`
- `TypeScript`
- `Express.js`
- `PostgreSQL`
- `bcrypt`
- `JSON Web Tokens (JWT)`

## 🚀Features

- Manage vehicles with availability tracking
- Customer profiles and account management
- Rental bookings with cost calculations
- Role-based authentication for Admins and Customers
- Clean modular structure: routes, controllers, services
- PostgreSQL database integration

## 📍The Process

I started this project by setting up foundation using Express and TypeScript to ensure the codebase is structured, typed, and scalable from the beginning. The goal is to build a modular backend where each feature, authentication, users, vehicles, and bookings is separated into clear layers. PostgreSQL integration is the next step, followed by implementing the core business logic. This README will evolve as the system becomes more fully featured, but the groundwork for the API is officially in place.
